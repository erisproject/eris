Eris - agent based economic modelling library

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Eris is a C++ library designed for simulating “economies“ consisting of agents
who follow programmable rules, with the intention of deriving complex
macro-level behaviour that is an emergent property of agent interaction.

This project was motivated by the inadequacy of mathematical models, which
often impose severe constraints on agents in the name of tractability.

At its core, this library imposes few constraints on the behaviour of agents.
Individuals agents can, for instance, be programmed to be ultra-rational, or
can be “dumb” in the sense of following only simple rules of thumb.

Beyond the core, the library offers many specialized implementations that may
be used as appropriate, but can equally well be replaced with alternative
implementations.

The library name, Eris, is the name of the Greek god of chaos.
