eris (1.0.0~pre20160409-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * 1.0.0 snapshot
  * Require Eigen 3.2.7+ for proper move support
  * Fix eigen version detection
  * Added probit test script
  * BayesianLinear update/weaken redesign
  * BayesianLinear API updates
  * Added proper truncated_normal_distribution, use it in
    BayesianLinearRestricted.
  * Use boost for randomness (rng and distributions) instead of stl.  Boost's
    implementations are faster, especially for Normal (since 1.56.0); I've
    submitted patches to make normal a bit faster and exponential much faster,
    forthcoming (hopefully) in 1.62.0.
  * Initial bayesian probit class shell (WIP)
  * Documentation fixes/updates
  * BayesianLinear: matrix improvements; other fixes
  * Made Random a namespace with functions instead of a static class; relax
    thread seeding
  * Added BayesianLinear.Vinvinv() to get V matrix
