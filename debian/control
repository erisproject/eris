Description: Eris economics agent-based modelling library (shared library)
 Eris is a C++ library for creating agent-based economics models that simulate
 "economies" consisting of agents who follow programmable rules, with the
 intention of deriving complex macro behaviour from the micro behaviour and
 interactions of individual agents.
 .
 This package contains the shared library used by eris applications.
