    /** A RAII-style locking class for holding one or more simultaneous Member locks.  Locks are
     * established during object construction and released when the object is destroyed.  A Lock may
     * be copied, in which case all copies must be destroyed before the lock is automatically
     * released.
     *
     * This class satisfies the requirements of Lockable (that is, is has lock(), unlock(), and
     * try_lock() methods).
     *
     * When locking multiple objects at once, this class is designed to avoid deadlocks: it will not
     * block while waiting for a lock while it holds any open locks; instead if a lock cannot be
     * obtained, any previous locks are released while waiting for the locked object to become
     * unlocked.  Construction (or a lock() call) do not return until all required locks are held.
     *
     * There are provided public methods for manually releasing and re-obtaining the locks, and
     * methods for converting a read lock into a write lock and vice-versa.  These methods are
     * typically not needed (when object lifetime will suffice), but available for convenience for
     * more precise lock control.
     *
     * It is not recommended (or supported) to access a Lock object from multiple threads.
     *
     * If the simulation is not using threads at all (that is, maxThreads() is 0), the methods of
     * this class do nothing substantial: no actual locking operations are performed thus
     * eliminating locking overhead when locking is pointless.
     *
     * If you need to obtain multiple Member::Locks at once (for example, to hold a read lock on
     * some members and a write lock on others), you should first unlock all locks, then call use
     * std::lock() to reobtain locks on all of them.
     *
     * Implementation details:
     *
     * Every Member-derived object has a lock mutex that governs write access to the object.
     * Additionally, each Member has a readlocks variable (access to which requires locking the
     * mutex).  A write lock is thus a case of holding the mutex while readlocks is set to 0.  A
     * read lock is simply an object that has readlocks set to a value greater than 0.  Establishing
     * a read lock thus requires locking the mutex, incrementing the readlocks variable, then
     * releasing the mutex lock.
     *
     * To establishing a lock in both cases (read or write), we first try (in a non-blocking way) to
     * obtain mutex locks on all of the Member-derived objects to be locked.  If any of them fails
     * (either because locking the mutex would block, or because need a write lock but when we got
     * the mutex lock the object has readlocks > 0, and thus must wait for outstanding readlock(s)
     * to finish), we unlock any held mutexes then do a blocking lock on the failed mutex.  When we
     * finally get that lock, we restart the process.
     *
     * Once we get through the entire set of mutexes, and thus hold locks on all required objects,
     * if we want a write lock, we're finished.  If we want a read lock, we increment all the
     * objects' readlocks variable, then release all the mutex locks.
     *
     * Unlocking is easier: for a write lock, we simply release all the mutex locks.  For a read
     * lock,Â we have to briefly a obtain a mutex lock on the object, decrement its readlocks
     * variable, then release the mutex lock.  (Since a Lock object never holds a mutex lock while
     * waiting for something else, these blocking locks are guaranteed to be non-deadlocking).
