This is a miniscule debian package that builds a package containing symlinks
from the usual system locations to the eris build directory "build" in the
root of the current eris project root (i.e. ../../build).

It requires a successfully built eris in ../../build.

This can be most easily generated via cmake, which will include a
eris-symlinks_0_(arch).deb target when building on a debian-like system with
the dpkg-dev package installed.

Note that new top-level eris includes (e.g. any new items in directory
containing Simulation.hpp) will require a rebuild of this package to create
the new symlinks.  Likewise for new include items that end up in
../../build/eris.
