         * Lock may be copied, in which case all copies must be destroyed before the lock is
         * automatically released.
         *
         * When locking multiple objects at once, this class is designed to avoid deadlocks: it will
         * not block while waiting for a lock while it holds any open locks; instead if a lock
         * cannot be obtained, any previous locks are released while waiting for the locked object
         * to become unlocked.  Construction (or a lock() call) do not return until all required
         * locks are held.
         *
         * There are provided public methods for manually releasing and re-obtaining the locks, and
         * methods for converting a read lock into a write lock and vice-versa.  These methods are
         * typically not needed (when object lifetime will suffice), but available for convenience
         * for more precise lock control.
         *
         * It is not recommended (or supported) to access a Lock object from multiple threads.
         *
         * If the simulation is not using threads at all (that is, maxThreads() is 0), the methods
         * of this class do nothing substantial: no actual locking operations are performed thus
         * eliminating locking overhead when locking is pointless.
         *
         * Implementation details:
         *
         * Every Member-derived object has a lock mutex that governs write access to the object.
         * Additionally, each Member has a readlocks variable (access to which requires locking the
         * mutex).  A write lock is thus a case of holding the mutex while readlocks is set to 0.  A
         * read lock is simply an object that has readlocks set to a value greater than 0.
         * Establishing a read lock thus requires locking the mutex, incrementing the readlocks
         * variable, then releasing the mutex lock.
         *
         * To establishing a lock in both cases (read or write), we first try (in a non-blocking
         * way) to obtain mutex locks on all of the Member-derived objects to be locked.  If any of
         * them fails (either because locking the mutex would block, or because need a write lock
         * but when we got the mutex lock the object has readlocks > 0, and thus must wait for
         * outstanding readlock(s) to finish), we unlock any held mutexes then do a blocking lock on
         * the failed mutex.  When we finally get that lock, we restart the process.
         *
         * Once we get through the entire set of mutexes, and thus hold locks on all required
         * objects, if we want a write lock, we're finished.  If we want a read lock, we increment
         * all the objects' readlocks variable, then release all the mutex locks.
         *
         * Unlocking is easier: for a write lock, we simply release all the mutex locks.  For a read
         * lock,Â we have to briefly a obtain a mutex lock on the object, decrement its readlocks
         * variable, then release the mutex lock.  (Since a Lock object never holds a mutex lock
         * while waiting for something else, these blocking locks are guaranteed to be
         * non-deadlocking).
